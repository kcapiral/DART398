					<h1>Waark.</h1>

						<p>Beautifully, colorfully, graphically designed. The animation emphasizes the abstract illustrations. The color palette is well chosen and matches very well with one another. The combination of serif and sans serif type works very well together. The logo is simple but still stands out on the website.</p>
					<p class="subtitle">Usability</p>
						<p>A very easy to navigate website. In order to scroll, there are various ways to move from one section of the page to another. You can either click the hamburger menu to go straight to a section, or swipe/drag up depending on what console is being used. There’s even an indication at the bottom but the usability is still very intuitive.</p>
