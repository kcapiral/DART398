					<p class="subtitle">Concept / Research</p>
					
						<p>The concept I chose is related to research that I’ve been doing personally for the past few months. This May, I am going to Japan for the first time and I had no clue what I was going to do or where I was going to go. After some elaborate and at times frustrating research, I realized that all the information I gathered about the places to visit in Japan were from many different websites and videos. Therefore, I decided to compile the information I have and other research to make a website showing the best 9 places to visit in Japan and what there is to do in those 9 places. These are a mixture of traditional, cultural, shopping and eating areas that young adults between the ages of 20-30 years old would want to visit. They are: Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Hokkaido, Okinawa, Hyogo, Chiba and Fukuoka. Below, are the full details for Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. Following them, are just brief introductions to the other prefectures which will later be found in full details on the actual website.</p>
						
					<p class="subtitle">Tokyo (Shibuya, Akihabara, Harajuku)</p>
						
						<p>Shibuya is best known for its Shibuya crossing, a large intersection surrounded by entertainment, shopping and food districts. It’s one of the heavily dense areas when pedestrians start crossing in all directions to get to their destination. You can go shopping at the popular Shibuya 109 or at a chain thrift shop called Don Quixote. Shibuya is known to be the “center for youth fashion and culture” (japan-guide.com). A statue for Japan’s most popular dog, Hachinko, the shiba inu, is also of walking distance from the Shibuya crossing. </p>
						
						<p>Akihabara is every otaku’s (person obsessed with computers and/or manga) dream. It’s filled with advertisements from animes, games and j-pop idols. The cosplay cafes are mostly located here, where you can be treated as a “master” and be served by someone dressed particularly in a maid or butler uniform. Or visit many arcades and win a lot of cute or cool plushies and action figures. Technology thrives in Akihabara, so finding computers, gaming consoles and every electrical device or part can be found here. For every otaku’s desire, there’s many manga and anime stores that sell figurines, mangas, posters and more. </p>
						
						<p>Harajuku is the neighbourhood for all the Japanese trends, such as Lolita, Decora, Ganguru and many more. It’s not unusual if you see someone decked out in a certain and unique style. It’s a place where a lot of fashionably Tokyo teens hangout and there are a lot of interesting clothing stores that cater to certain styles. There are also big name stores such as H&M and Forever 21 here as well. Many cafes gift shops and boutiques are situated here so there are many fun and interesting things to explore in Harajuku. </p>
						
					<p class="subtitle">Osaka (Shinsaibashi, Dotonbori)</p>
						
						<p>Shinsaibashi is a great place in Osaka to go shopping for local street goods to high end brands. This is called the Shinsaibashi Shopping Arcade. An interesting shop that sells unique gifts and knick-knacks is Alice on Wednesday. They sell a variety of cool and weird products that are great as gifts. For the night time goers, there are a lot of fun bars and nightclubs.  </p>
						
						<p>Dotonbori is especially unique because it’s considered to be the “culinary capitol of the world” (JB Macatulad, willflyforfood.com). People come here for the food, as it’s filled with restaurants, street foods and specialized food stores. Dotonbori showcases a lot of crazy and oversized signages, such as the Glico Man, a large octopus, a large sushi and more. </p>
						
																		
					<p class="subtitle">Kyoto (Fushimi, Arishiyama, Downtown Kyoto)</p>
						
						<p>Fushimi is best-known for the Fushimi Inari Taishi, a large shrine containing thousands of vermilion torii gates which you can take a stroll through found on the Southeast of Kyoto. The torii gates can be found all over the entire mountain that the shrine is located on and is open to explore. </p>
						
						<p>Arishiyama is another important sight-seeing locations in Kyoto. Most importantly, the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove on the West of Kyoto. It’s a forest filled of bamboo which you can walk through. </p>
						
						<p>Downtown Kyoto strays a bit away from nature but still offers a lot of spots such as “hotels, shops, restaurants, bars and clubs” (insidekyoto.com). You can purchase traditional Japanese foods and specialty items, while strolling around in a yukata. As a traditional and old district, it’s normal for people to wear the traditional Japanese outfits on the streets. You may even see some geishas. </p>		
						
					<p class="subtitle">Nara (Nara Park)</p>
						
						<p>Nara is also another traditional prefecture and has a lot of shrines but an interesting tourist location is the Nara Park. It’s popular because visitors roam around the park alongside many deers. There are more than “1200 stags, does and Bambis” (Lisa Kadane, theglobeandmail.com) wandering around the park, which you may feed and may interact with you.  </p>
																				
					<p class="subtitle">Hokkaido (Okinawa)</p>
						
						<p>Hokkaido is not only a prefecture, but an island, north of Japan. It’s popular for its untouched wilderness and seafood. Okinawa is a Japanese vacation location that’s known for their “white-sand beaches, fantastic snorkelling and diving sites, great food and unique culture” (wanderwisdom.com). Places to visit in Okinawa includes Taketomi Island and Iriomote Island.  </p>
																				
					<p class="subtitle">Hyogo (Hyogo)</p>
						
						<p>Hyogo, or also known as Kobe, is the one and only place to eat Kobe beef! Or visiting the Himeji Castle, one of the “most spectacular castles in Japan” (wasa-bi.com). Chiba is one hour away from Tokyo, but has a more nature-like atmosphere. You can visit Mt. Nokogiri for a hike or Yoro Valley. </p>
																				
					<p class="subtitle">Fukuoka (Fukuoka)</p>
						
						<p>Lastly, there’s Fukuoka where you can visit Nakasu for nightlife entertainment or visit its many shrines and castles. </p>
																					
					<p class="subtitle">Design</p>
					
						<p>Japan is a very modern but also very traditional. Modern and traditional are two distinct times however, they exist together in Japan. Therefore, I want to use a complimentary palette using vibrant and soft, pastel colors. They would be an array of colors, each shade representing one of the nine prefectures of Japan. </p>
						
						<p>Each prefecture will have their own illustration of a specific shade in the style of linear and graphic shapes. The illustrations are not realistic, but they will reflect in abstract and in a minimal design the essence of the specific prefecture. The dominating shape in the illustration will be visually graphic, while objects or secondary shapes and forms will be in a rounded outline style. I chose linearity and graphics because it’s a reoccurring style in Japanese poster designs. </p>
						
						<p>The typography will compliment and act as part of the illustrations, therefore it will be linear and have a rounded edge. Domus from Just Another Foundry is a type that is linear, rounded and contains graphic negative spaces. It will be used for the headers and the navigation. The secondary font would be thinner and slightly more condensed to give it contrast to Domus. It would be used for long texts such as paragraphs. </p>
						
					<p class="subtitle">User Experience</p>
					
						<p>To navigate through the website, the user will land on an overview of all the 9 prefectures. It is a zoomed out page where all the prefectures are in a grid of 3x3. On the top left is the logotype of the website and on the right is a burger menu. The user will click on one of the 9 rectangles and the screen will instantly zoom into the selected box. The box of the prefecture takes up most of the screen now, with left, right, up and down arrows indicating that the user can move to another prefecture by those buttons. When the user clicks on the prefecture’s box, the box will expand into a full screen and thus a new page will load below it. In this sub page, the user can read about more location specific areas from that prefecture as they scroll down. This sub page will have a vertical parallax effect and each prefecture location is it’s own section. As the user scrolls, the logo and hamburger menu are fixed and an upwards arrow can be found on the bottom right of the page in case the user wants to go back to the top. </p>
						
					<p class="subtitle">Languages</p>
					
						<p>In addition to HTML, my website will have at least two style sheets; one for the index and one for the sub pages. The arrow functions will use either JQuery or JavaScript to navigate left, right, up or down on the index page. Also, the burger menu will be coded using CSS. </p>
