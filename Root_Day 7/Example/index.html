        	<p>He learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon living at Stanmore, who had come in the small hours from a dangerous case at Pinner, and heard at some railway station on his way of the Martian advance.  He had hurried home, roused the women--their servant had left them two days before--packed some provisions, put his revolver under the seat--luckily for my brother--and told them to drive on to Edgware, with the idea of getting a train there.  He stopped behind to tell the neighbours.  He would overtake them, he said, at about half past four in the morning, and now it was nearly nine and they had seen nothing of him.  They could not stop in Edgware because of the growing traffic through the place, and so they had come into this side lane.</p>

            <p>"I did not know, Ghak," I cried.  "I did not know.  Not for all Pellucidar would I have harmed Dian the Beautiful by word, or look, or act of mine.  I do not want her as my slave.  I do not want her as my&mdash;" but here I stopped.  The vision of that sweet and innocent face floated before me amidst the soft mists of imagination, and where I had on the second believed that I clung only to the memory of a gentle friendship I had lost, yet now it seemed that it would have been disloyalty to her to have said that I did not want Dian the Beautiful as my mate.  I had not thought of her except as a welcome friend in a strange, cruel world.  Even now I did not think that I loved her.</p>
			<p>I believe Ghak must have read the truth more in my expression than in my words, for presently he laid his hand upon my shoulder.</p>
			<p>"Man of another world," he said, "I believe you.  Lips may lie, but when the heart speaks through the eyes it tells only the truth.  Your heart has spoken to me.  I know now that you meant no affront to Dian the Beautiful.  She is not of my tribe; but her mother is my sister. She does not know it&mdash;her mother was stolen by Dian's father who came with many others of the tribe of Amoz to battle with us for our women&mdash;the most beautiful women of Pellucidar.  Then was her father king of Amoz, and her mother was daughter of the king of Sari&mdash;to whose power I, his son, have succeeded.  Dian is the daughter of kings, though her father is no longer king since the sadok tossed him and Jubal the Ugly One wrested his kingship from him.  Because of her lineage the wrong you did her was greatly magnified in the eyes of all who saw it.  She will never forgive you."</p>
